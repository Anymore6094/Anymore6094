- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anymore6094
- 👀 I’m interested in building a homelab to house several applications, such as a NAS, VPN and virtualizer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux, and Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the andOTPredux for fun. I'm too cheap to get the Bitwarden pro version for the OTP capability. 
- 📫 How to reach me best would be on here, as I like my personal space.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know what I'm doing haha.
